this package is generated from the `matrix-js-sdk` code base by [generate-matrix-js-sdk-type](https://github.com/Jack-Works/generate-matrix-js-sdk-type).

Current commit hash of matrix-js-sdk: [f547fa732f1c8261231ce4ca929fbbb7d4030560](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/commit/f547fa732f1c8261231ce4ca929fbbb7d4030560) (v9.7.0+)

Please don't modify any file by hand in the `dts` folder.

How to use:

```ts
// @ts-ignore
import _matrix from "matrix-js-sdk";
const matrix: typeof import("matrix-js-sdk-type/dts/matrix.d") = _matrix;
```

now the matrix is typed.
