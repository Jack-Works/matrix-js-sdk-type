     * Construct a new Indexed Database store, which extends MemoryStore.

     * This store functions like a MemoryStore except it periodically persists
     * the contents of the store to an IndexedDB backend.
     *
     * All data is still kept in-memory but can be loaded from disk by calling
     * <code>startup()</code>. This can make startup times quicker as a complete
     * sync from the server is not required. This does not reduce memory usage as all
     * the data is eagerly fetched when <code>startup()</code> is called.
     * <pre>
     * let opts = { indexedDB: window.indexedDB, localStorage: window.localStorage };
     * let store = new IndexedDBStore(opts);
     * await store.startup(); // load from indexed db

     *     store: store,

     * class is provided for this purpose and requires the application to provide a

     * object will be used if it exists.
     * @prop {IndexedDBStoreBackend} backend The backend instance. Call through to
