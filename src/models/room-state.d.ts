     * Construct room state.
     *
     * Room State represents the state of the room at a given point.
     * It can be mutated by adding state events to it.
     * There are two types of room member associated with a state event:
     * normal member objects (accessed via getMember/getMembers) which mutate
     * with the state to represent the current state of that room/user, eg.
     * the object returned by getMember('@bob:example.com') will mutate to
     * get a different display name if Bob later changes his display name
     * in the room.
     * There are also 'sentinel' members (accessed via getSentinelMember).
     * These also represent the state of room members at the point in time
     * represented by the RoomState object, but unlike objects from getMember,
     * sentinel objects will always represent the room state as at the time
     * getSentinelMember was called, so if Bob subsequently changes his display
     * name, a room member object previously acquired with getSentinelMember
     * will still have his old display name. Calling getSentinelMember again
     * after the display name change will return a new RoomMember object
     * with Bob's new display name.
     *
     * @constructor
     * @param {?string} roomId Optional. The ID of the room which has this state.
     * If none is specified it just tracks paginationTokens, useful for notifTimelineSet
     * @param {?object} oobMemberFlags Optional. The state of loading out of bound members.
     * As the timeline might get reset while they are loading, this state needs to be inherited
     * and shared when the room state is cloned for the new timeline.
     * This should only be passed from clone.
     * @prop {Object.<string, RoomMember>} members The room member dictionary, keyed
     * on the user's ID.
     * @prop {Object.<string, Object.<string, MatrixEvent>>} events The state
     * events dictionary, keyed on the event type and then the state_key value.
     * @prop {string} paginationToken The pagination token for this state.
