     * Construct a new Room.
     *
     * <p>For a room, we store an ordered sequence of timelines, which may or may not
     * be continuous. Each timeline lists a series of events, as well as tracking
     * the room state at the start and the end of the timeline. It also tracks
     * forward and backward pagination tokens, as well as containing links to the
     * next timeline in the sequence.
     *
     * <p>There is one special timeline - the 'live' timeline, which represents the
     * timeline to which events are being added in real-time as they are received
     * from the /sync API. Note that you should not retain references to this
     * timeline - even if it is the current timeline right now, it may not remain
     * so if the server gives us a timeline gap in /sync.
     *
     * <p>In order that we can find events from their ids later, we also maintain a
     * map from event_id to timeline and index.
     *

     * @param {*} opts.storageToken Optional. The token which a data store can use

     * event type and the values are the events.
     * @prop {RoomState} oldState The state of the room at the time of the oldest
