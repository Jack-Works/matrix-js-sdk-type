/**
  * Construct room state.
  *
  * Room State represents the state of the room at a given point.
  * It can be mutated by adding state events to it.
  * There are two types of room member associated with a state event:
  * normal member objects (accessed via getMember/getMembers) which mutate
  * with the state to represent the current state of that room/user, eg.
  * the object returned by getMember('@bob:example.com') will mutate to
  * get a different display name if Bob later changes his display name
  * in the room.
  * There are also 'sentinel' members (accessed via getSentinelMember).
  * These also represent the state of room members at the point in time
  * represented by the RoomState object, but unlike objects from getMember,
  * sentinel objects will always represent the room state as at the time
  * getSentinelMember was called, so if Bob subsequently changes his display
  * name, a room member object previously acquired with getSentinelMember
  * will still have his old display name. Calling getSentinelMember again
  * after the display name change will return a new RoomMember object
  * with Bob's new display name.
  * @constructor
  * @param {?string} roomId Optional. The ID of the room which has this state.
  * If none is specified it just tracks paginationTokens, useful for notifTimelineSet
  * @param {?object} oobMemberFlags Optional. The state of loading out of bound members.
  * As the timeline might get reset while they are loading, this state needs to be inherited
  * and shared when the room state is cloned for the new timeline.
  * This should only be passed from clone.
  * @prop {object.<string, RoomMember>} members The room member dictionary, keyed
  * on the user's ID.
  * @prop {object.<string, object.<string, MatrixEvent>>} events The state
  * events dictionary, keyed on the event type and then the state_key value.
  * @prop {string} paginationToken The pagination token for this state.
